# About
In my day job, I work as a scientific data engineer. This role involves curating datasets and maintaining databases, as well as building predictive models. You can find more about my professional career on my LinkedIn profile <a href="linkedin.com/in/noah-knox">here</a>. I'm always open to connection requests and messages, so feel free to reach out!

In my free time, I love to code, analyze data, and build things! Some important subcategories of projects you can find on my page can be found below.

## Fraud and money laundering detection using open source UK company data
<a href="https://github.com/NIEKnox/Companies-House-Connections-Mapper">Here</a> you can find my current focus, which in my opinion is the most interesting and relevant to those of you who may be visiting (hello!). This network mapping tool I've been developing works to answer the question: <p>
<b><i>Can we use historical fraud data, where it's associated with a registered company, to identify patterns that may lead us to other fraudulently operating companies that haven't been found out yet?</b></i><p>
It's a lofty ambition, and you can read my writeup of looking into some of this already on the linked repository. I'm currently looking into parsing micro company accounts to identify patterns in financial reports (eapecially around Covid, where the insolvency service has been reporting on people who over-represented their turnover to get higher Covid support loans). 
If you found this interesting, Bellingcat has an open source tool that does something similar (that I had no idea existed before I started working on this myself...) <a href="https://github.com/bellingcat/sugartrail">here</a>.

## Discord bots
I've been using Discord for almost a decade by this point, and over the course of that time I've been involved in a lot of online events and communities. For some of these, I coded my own discord bots using discord.py, and also made one that helped connect it to Google sheets, too. If you need to create a Discord bot for an event, maybe check these ones out and see if you can use them for your own purposes!<p>
<li><b><a href="https://github.com/NIEKnox/clashBOT">ClashBot</a></b> was a Discord bot made for a DnD 5e, gameshow-themed event played over a weekend in 2021. Due to the impact of Covid, the event couldn't be run in person. We took advantage of that by utilizing a custom Discord bot to manage certain things the players could have fun with; this included a lootbox mechanic that the refs could fill up a Google sheet with items the players could draw from, and a voting system where players could query another spreadsheet and see how many other characters had voted for theirs. <p>If I was to go back again, there are a <i>lot</i> of things I'd have improved for the bot (namely, improved caching and querying of the Google sheets) and I've come a long way in my programming journey since then.
</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/NIEKnox/RepulsionBot">Repulsion</a></b> was an online LARP-like game that involved politicking, espionage, and covert communication. I feel especially proud of this bot, as I created a messaging system that allowed players to message other players through the bot, which would allow us moderating the game to keep abreast of any developments, ensure fair play and good standards of behaviour, while allowing people to cleverly maneuver should they want to message someone and pretend to be someone else.<p>
  This system also allowed us to integrate another crucial part of the espionage game into this: compromised communication. Players had the ability to 'bug' another player provided certain game conditions were met, which meant any message received or sent by the bugged player would <i>also</i> go to the person who placed the bug. This lead to some fantastic gameplay moments and really allowed an intelligent game of information management and control to emerge.

## Project Zomboid Modding
Project Zomboid may be my most played game of all time, standing at around 2.5k hours on Steam. I made the inadvisable decision of spending one Christmas morning trying to learn Lua so I could make some mods I felt were missing from my play experience. I still don't know how Lua's table system works, but maybe someday I will!
<li><b><a href="https://github.com/NIEKnox/pzExAqua">Ex Aqua</a></b> is a mod for build 41 that's currently in development, intended for use with the "Waterworld" mod. Have you ever played a Minecraft skyblock modpack? The concept is a little bit like that (shout out to Ex Nihilo for the name inspiration). If you arent aware of what it is, the premise is that you can start with an extremely limited set of resources in a very confined space(in this case, whatever you can fish out of the water) and theoretically build up a giant base and work your way up to getting <i>everything</i> you need, all thanks to the bounty of the sea. This is very much in development and will likely need to be reworked for B42, but if you like this idea then any suggestions will always be appreciated!</li>
<li><b><a href="https://github.com/NIEKnox/expandedRoleplayProfessions">Expanded Roleplay Professions</a></b> was made in an attempt to add a wider variety of professions to the game, and starting them off at a slightly higher level for use in roleplay servers. Listen, you can't tell me that my character who's worked on cars for the past 40 years can't fix an engine, just give me the damn skill points already!</li>
<li>This isn't technically a mod, but <b><a href="https://github.com/NIEKnox/pzlogs">PZLogs</a></b> was a tool I made to be able to extract my Buffy's chatlogs from my files in a structured way. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to cache your side of the conversation, so you may need to merge logs with a friend to get the full set of logs.</li>
